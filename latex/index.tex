This project aims to add the Arbitrary Processor Affinity (A\+PA) scheduler to R\+T\+E\+MS. A\+PA scheduler would allow higher-\/priority tasks to be ”dislodged” or moved among processors in order to make space for lower priority tasks that are limited by affinity constraints.

We model the task to processor mapping as a bi-\/partite graph. An edge denotes a task being assigned a \hyperlink{structCPU}{C\+PU}.

When a processor A gets free, it looks for all the possible tasks that it can run. This includes the ready waiting task which have the processor A in their affinity set as well as the ready waiting task which has a processor B in its affinity set, but the processor B is executing a task which can be shifted to prcessor A and therefore the ready-\/waiting task being executed.

This algorithm runs recursively to find any possible task to processor mapping that does not violate the priority ordering and generates a mapping with the highest total priority of tasks begin executed.
